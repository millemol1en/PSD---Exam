(* A large type *)

let tex7 =

(* F# will not infer the same type as above (the variables in p1, p2, p3, p4
   will not be generalized) because of the so-called value restriction 
   on polymorphism, which ensures type system soundness in the presence of 
   destructive update.  An F# example similar to the above can be obtained by 
   eta-expansion: turning  let f = e  into  let f p = e p  which is valid
   when f is a function.  The type of p5 below involves 64 different type variables:

   let id x = x
   let pair x y p = p x y
   let p1 p = pair id id p
   let p2 p = pair p1 p1 p
   let p3 p = pair p2 p2 p
   let p4 p = pair p3 p3 p
   let p5 p = pair p4 p4 p
   in p5;;

(* A polymorphic function may be applied to itself *)

let tex8 = 
    inferType(fromString "let f x = x in f f end");;


(* Ill-typed examples ----------------------------------------- *)

(* A function f is not polymorphic in its own right-hand side,  *)

let teex1 () = 
    inferType(fromString "let f x = f 7 + f false in 4 end");;

(* f is not polymorphic in x because y is bound further out *)

let teex2 () = 
    inferType(fromString "let g y = let f x = (x=y) in f 1 = f false end in g end");;

(* circularity: function parameter h cannot be applied to itself *)

let teex3 () = 
    inferType(fromString "let g h = h h in let f x = x in g f end end");;
*)

    inferType(fromString @"
